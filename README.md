# 2.5D_Platformer

Creating a 2.5D platformer game within Unreal Engine marked the beginning of an exhilarating journey into game development with Unreal Engine for our two-person team. With an emphasis on utilizing Blueprints, we embarked on crafting an engaging experience that seamlessly merged player mechanics with intricate level design. As my partner delved into the artistic aspect, sculpting the terrain and conceptualizing the layout, I assumed responsibility for the technical framework that would underpin our creation.

Initially, my focus was on establishing the fundamentals of player interaction. Crafting the protagonist's movement mechanics became the cornerstone of our gameplay experience. With meticulous attention to detail, I programmed the character to navigate the environment, mastering forward, backwards, and jumping motions. Each step forward in development brought us closer to realizing our vision.

The introduction of environmental hazards added layers of complexity to our project. Implementing lasers that posed a threat to the player's health required a delicate balance between challenge and accessibility. Through a meticulous iteration process, we fine-tuned the damage and health systems, ensuring that encounters with these hazards felt both hard and fair.

As our project evolved, we sought to introduce other gameplay mechanics. The concept of pulling and pushing blocks emerged as a pivotal feature, enriching the puzzle-solving aspect of our levels. With precision and foresight, l integrated this mechanic into our gameplay loop, allowing players to manipulate their environment to overcome obstacles.

Collaboration and communication were paramount throughout the development process. Regular meetings and shared brainstorming sessions allowed us to exchange ideas, driving our project forward.

Note: this is just a sample level as I could find the complete and finished game. The work you will find shows the basic blueprint created.
